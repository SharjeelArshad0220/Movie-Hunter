## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- (Optional) A text editor if you want to modify the code

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
  - git clone [https://github.com/SharjeelArshad0220/Movie-Hunter/](https://github.com/SharjeelArshad0220/Movie-Hunter/)
  - cd moviehunt

2. **Open the app**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

3. **Get your own API key (optional but recommended)**
   - The project currently uses a hardcoded demo key (`8ccdd5462b8312deb7c49289201f7656`). For production or personal use, please get your own free key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
   - Replace the `API_KEY` variable in `utility.js` with your new key.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Because this is a client-side app, the API key is exposed in the source code. In a real‑world scenario you would proxy requests through a backend to hide the key. This project is intended for learning/portfolio purposes.
